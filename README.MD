# CUDA Practice

This is just the practice repo for my CUDA C & other low level systems journey. A lot of bad code. 

It will contain my initial self contained implementations for my computation Library, my main goals are of course Matrix operations, for multidimensional initially starting with 2d. So GEMM for now especially FP32 -> FP8 and further more quantization & optimization things I might learn for the AMD competition.

Right now this contains some Fractal code for the julia set, some Vector Add/Dot product scripts, matrix Transpose and finally Naive GEMM both CPU & GPU.
